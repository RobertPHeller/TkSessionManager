The TkSessionManager program is a simple but essentially complete
program launcher application that includes an ``electronic notepad'',
which is just a text area where text can be pasted, typed, or used to
collect the output of a program run at the command line\footnote{There
is a named pipe available to redirect the stdout and/or stderr of
programs.}. This text area can be saved to a text file or sent to a
printer.

The TkSessionManager program implements a launcher menu that is fully
user customizable. There is an integrated editor to edit the launcher
menu or the menu file can be edited with a standard text editor. This
menu can be defined to have sub-menus (cascading menus) and there is no
defined limit controlling the depth of the sub-menus. The program
includes an actions menu for system wide actions. It starts a
user-specified window manager and runs a session start up script to
launch a user-defined set of initial applications.
