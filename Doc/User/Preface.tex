I wrote this program as a replacement for the DECWindows session manager
that was included with the VAX/VMS DECWindows installation.  It is 
written entirely in Tcl/Tk, making use of the standard packages,
BWidget, SNIT, and Img.

It has evolved from somewhat simplier programs, first as just a menu
thingy to the current somewhat more featured program.  While it is true
that it is not as ``flashy'' as many Desktop Managers, it does what I
need it to do and it is a very lean application with a small resource
footprint.
